"""Sets up WikiApp's Python environment: App Files/.venv with the packages in requirements.txt,
and the agentlib library the AI features run on.

WikiApp.cmd (Windows) and WikiApp.command (macOS) run this before every start. When everything
is already installed it returns at once; it only installs on the first start, or after
requirements.txt (or the agentlib folder) changed. Needs Python 3.11 or newer (agentlib needs 3.11).

agentlib is a separate library, never copied into the app. It is looked for in the folders next
to the app's project folder, and one level inside each (the General-Purpose-Productivity repo keeps it next to wiki-app, the app's folder),
or wherever the app's Paths window points it (see host/pathlist.py). Exactly one found: it is
installed "editable", so the library is used where it is. None or several: the app still starts,
with the AI features off and a message saying why.

    python setup.py             set up, or bring up to date with requirements.txt
    python setup.py --upgrade   also update every package to its newest version
