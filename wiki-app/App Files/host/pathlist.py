"""Every file and folder WikiApp uses, in one list. Every path in the app comes from here.

WikiApp keeps everything private to one person in one folder named `.wiki`, at a place the
person chooses on the first start (the app's own project folder, the one holding WikiApp.cmd,
is suggested; .gitignore keeps it out of git). The only thing kept in a fixed place is a
one-line pointer file that records where that folder is:

    ~/.wikiapp-location            (WIKIAPP_POINTER_FILE overrides where it is, for tests)

WIKIAPP_DATA_DIR, when set, is the `.wiki` folder itself and the pointer is not read.

Each entry in the list has a name ("settings", "prompt.wiki-reviewer", "wiki.team.rules"...), a
path, a kind, a group and a state ("ok", "missing", "not_created", "unset": see STATES). Most
entries can be pointed somewhere else (an override, kept in the folder's paths.json); by default
they derive from the `.wiki` folder. Entries:

    app folder      app_folder, pointer_file, path_list
    app data        settings, window_placement, instance, engine_settings, pending_promotion,
                    run_history, indexes, progress, note_templates, prompts, wiki_settings (each
                    wiki's role and the Sessions tab's filter: see "Wiki roles" below)
    your own files  personal_capture_rules (.wiki/capture-rules.md): free-text rules for capture in
                    the personal wiki, the one place for them. A starter is copied in once if
                    missing; never updated, overwritten or reset; no status. personal_tags (the
                    person's own tags, a page in the personal wiki, made by the sessions tool when
                    the first one is added).
    file slots      three tiers (see MAIN_SLOTS, ADVANCED_SLOTS, INTERNAL below):
                    main: template.daily, template.weekly, copied into .wiki/note-templates/ where
                      missing; status "default" (unedited, follows newer defaults by itself),
                      "customised", "customised_newer_default"; reset_prompt() puts the default back.
                    advanced: the three agents' prompts, read from the app's own files ("built_in")
                      until customise_prompt() makes an editable copy in .wiki/prompts/;
                      reset_prompt() deletes the copy.
                    internal: request wording, samples, starters: never copied or listed, read
                      from the app's files by read_prompt().
    each wiki       wiki.<alias>.rules, wiki.<alias>.templates, wiki.<alias>.index,
                    wiki.<alias>.progress
    outside         notes_folder, transcripts, agentlib, sessions_config, tag_list_reference (unset
                    by default; any tags file, read only: the app never writes it)

Nothing here creates a folder the person didn't ask for: with no pointer file, nothing is
written at all, and a configured path that is gone is reported (exists = False), never made
again. Files are only ever created inside the `.wiki` folder, or where the person saves one.

Standard library only, Python 3.10+: setup.py, the ingest run and sessions/sb.py import it too.
